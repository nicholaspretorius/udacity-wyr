Project: Udacity React Nanodegree Project 2: Would you rather...

"Would you rather..." is an application that enables you to add questions to a collection for yourself and other users to answer. The more questions you ask, and the more questions you answer, the more points you get. Questions are asked in the format: 

"Would you rather ____ or ____?"

For example: 

"Would you rather be an astronaut or a scuba diver?"

All questions and answers are recorded for points. (There are no "wrong" answers). Once you have answered a question, you will see a calculation of how many people selected which answer.

Please note: There is a Console Warning about the 'react-redux-loading' component as used in the course material. This is related to the component and not to my project code - I did not change this since it was used in the course material.
